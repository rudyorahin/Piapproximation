# PI Approximation in Java

## Description

This project provides a Java application to approximate the value of Pi using Monte Carlo simulation. The approximation is calculated based on the number of randomly generated points that fall inside a unit circle divided by the total number of points.

## Features

- Approximates the value of Pi
- Displays the approximation difference compared to Java's `Math.PI`
- JUnit test for validation

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/PIapproximation.git
```
Navigate to the src/main/java/edu/gcccd/csis directory to find the source files.

## Usage
Compile and run the PIapproximation.java file. The application will prompt you to enter the number of points to use for the approximation. Here's how it works:

1. Compile the code:
```bash
javac PIapproximation.java
```

2. Run the program:
```bash
java PIapproximation
```

## Running Tests
Navigate to the src/test/java/edu/gcccd/csis directory and run the PIapproximationTest.java to validate the approximation within a given margin of error.
